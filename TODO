* records 
** Add more documentation.
** Disable read-only text when it is copied somewhere.
** Add more functionality in the index mode.
** Simple key strokes on notes subjects.
** records-directory-structure should have more possibilities:
   - example concat (year, month).
** emacs front end to recordsadmin.

* build system
** make dist should automatically sign the tarballs with something
   like:

   	  gpg --armor --sign --detach-sig <tarball>

   this would produce <tarball>.asc
   Sadly, automake dist-hook is run *before* the tarballs are
   effectively created thus defeating our strategy.
** make release could automatically update both our ChangeLog but also
   automatically updat debian/changelog to get a new Debian package.
** even more make targets could include
*** automatic construction of debian package:
   	  dpkg-buildpackage -v$(LASTUPLOAD) $(BUILDOPTS) \
	    -us -uc -rfakeroot && \
	  echo "Running lintian ..." && \
	  lintian -i ../$(DEBNAME)_$(VERSION)*.deb || : && \
	  echo "Done running lintian." && \
	  debsign)
*** upload to our launchpad.net account
*** prepare a suitable announcement message
