Make sure that you read the README file first.

Run

1. ./configure
This program is provided in the source (do not run your own configure).
If you want to specify the directory in which notesadmin should be installed,
you could say something like

./configure --prefix $HOME

Make sure ${bindir} (generally ${prefix}/bin) in the Makefile exists and is
writable by you.

2. make install (or just make)
After the lisp files have been compiled, this procedure is interactive and asks
for user defaults.

3. The changes to your system that "make install" does are the following:

a) Adds ~/.emacs-notes (if this file already exists, it converts only specific
parts of the file).

b) Adds a couple of lines to ~/.emacs

c) Adds notesadmin to ${bindir}

d) Creates your notes directory (~/notes or whatever you have specified during
make) and adds some indexes there. If this directory already exists, then it
reindexes your notes and converts them to the new format. If you don't trust
the conversion, I would really suggest that you KEEP A COPY OF YOUR NOTES
BEFORE DOING THE CONVERSION. Check the conversion by hand to make sure that the
conversion is fine. Specially look for the following: HAVE EMBEDDED LINKS IN
YOUR NOTES BEEN CONVERTED CORRECTLY. Please tell me if this conversion is not
okay.
