Make sure that you read the README file first.

Run

1. ./configure
This program is provided in the source (do not run your own configure).
If you want to specify the directory in which notesadmin should be installed,
you could say something like

./configure --prefix $HOME

or 

./configure --bindir $HOME/bin

2. make install (or just make)
After the lisp files have been compiled, this procedure is interactive and asks
for user defaults.

The installation just puts notesadmin in your bin path (see README).
